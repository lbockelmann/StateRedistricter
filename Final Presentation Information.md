## Final Presentation Information 

Important Points
 - This is like presenting a contract fulfillment (use cases) to a customer (not technical)
 - We define the order for our system: whatever we think is most logical for displaying
 - Do not forget to bring a summary sheet with copies (should have our order presentation of use cases)
 - Use cases are checked off as they happen. Go through and Bob checks things off as they happen
 - Difficult to display use cases (like algorithm ones) are shown by grouping some use cases together and demonstrating that the only way the algorithm could do some thing / perform some way is if these use cases were implemented 
 - Suspend builds 24 hours before we present (do not make that mistake)
 - Whatever you get to in 30 minutes is what you get --> make sure everything is working smoothly and well
 - Do lots of dry runs to make sure you do all the cases in 30 minutes because if you miss some you miss the points too 
 - Test plan adherence is part of the grade 
 - Interesting states will be cool and good to demo for quality but they will probably take longer 
 - State will be chosen, but with justification, you can switch the states (will affect quality score most likely)
 - If you switch states because you lack data it will cost you quality points but it will be better obviously
 - Show some demonstration (1-2 slides) that you adhered to the plan somehow
 - or justify why you didn't (something more useful, lack of data) 
 - Recognize what you did at least 
 - We should be running the final presentation from **our own database**
 - All data must be uploaded and present there but we can run from our own database 
 - Set up quickly and be familiar with the room: do not delay the setup 
 - [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) says Bob
 - Dry runs will be different times says Bob 
 - Bob's Advice: Come up with 2 or 3 things for every use case that you need to say. Follow the use case list yourself to keep time. Make sure half the use cases are done by half the time being over, speed up, as needed
 - Have a person talking, driving the laptop, maybe keeping time? I don't know man
 - Do not have any dead time (there's no time for it)
 - Do not be too technical (it's a customer presentation)
 - Discuss features and how they work 
 - He says the master use case list can be updated every day up until your presentation for some reason
 - Performance issues need to be worked out or else the presentation will be too slow and you won't get to do all your use cases
 - If your algorithm takes a REALLY long time to do an algorithming, run it to completion and show a completed map and compare it to the original. Say that you don't have the time but here is a result 
 - Remember that we will have to talk about the test plan and what we tested and why
 - We will need a 1 page summary of where we obtained the data (and data quality issues) electronically and on paper during the final presentation
 - If you cannot get precinct data you can estimate by district data or county data (demographics is all he mentioned but maybe more?)
 - Do not study for the final he says  he says its easy if u know ur team and worked on the project  it lasts 45 minutes
