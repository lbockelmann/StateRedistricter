## AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

The root folder of the webapp goes in /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/ right 
in the same directory as ROOT (the manager webapp) 

I believe this is CATALINA_HOME 

Permissions are a mess 

the Place to go is localhost:8080/CSE308 (which is the name of the folder 
that is the root of the webapp. 

Be sure the file structure is correct and the web.xml has the 
proper serlet mappings
